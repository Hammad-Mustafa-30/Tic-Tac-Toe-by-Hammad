# Tic-Tac-Toe-by-Hammad

///////////////////////////////////////////// MUST READ /////////////////////////////////////////////

The game was created in Dev-C++. However, Dev-C++ does not include graphics.h library by default. So
this game will not work until you install graphics.h library manually. You can search on YouTube 
"How to install graphics.h library in Dev-C++" and watch any video to install this library

AssalamuAlaikum everyone!

I am excited to share my Tic Tac Toe Game that I recently created in C++ using the graphics.h library.
It has been an exciting project for me as I built the graphics from scratch, and I am proud of the
final result.

The code for my Tic Tac Toe Game is well-structured and easy to read, making it an excellent resource 
for anyone who is interested in learning more about C++ programming. It makes use of various C++ 
features, such as arrays and loops, to create a clean and concise codebase that is easy to modify and 
extend.

One of the most interesting aspects of the code for my Tic Tac Toe Game is the AI component. I 
implemented a simple AI algorithm that allows the computer opponent to adapt to the player's moves 
and choose the most strategic moves in response. This code can be a valuable resource for anyone who 
is interested in learning more about AI programming.

Additionally, the code for my Tic Tac Toe Game also showcases the use of the graphics.h library to 
create interactive graphics and user interfaces. This library can be a bit challenging to work with, 
but the code that I've written makes it easy to understand and implement in your own projects.

Overall, I am excited to share the code for my Tic Tac Toe Game with anyone who is interested in 
learning more about C++ programming, AI programming, or graphics programming. I hope that this project 
will be a valuable resource for anyone who is looking to improve their skills and knowledge in these 
areas.
